Our Solution: Hemora

An intelligent, agentic AI-powered blood bank management system that predicts, monitors, and autonomously acts to prevent shortage and wastage.

THE PROBLEMS FACED:

A. Blood Shortages
-Why: Hospitals don’t know in real-time which blood groups are available; sudden emergencies cause shortages.
-Impact: Patients in critical condition may not get timely transfusions.

B. Blood Wastage
-Why: Blood has a shelf life of 30–42 days. Expiry isn’t tracked effectively, and transportation/redistribution is poor.
-Impact: Millions of units go unused each year, despite demand elsewhere.

C. Manual, Fragmented Systems
-Why: Many hospitals still maintain paper logs or disconnected digital records.
-Impact: Hard to coordinate stock between hospitals, predict demand, or respond to emergencies.

D. Hospitals lack predictive foresight—they react to shortages instead of preventing them

THE ROOT CAUSE:

-No real-time visibility into blood inventory across departments
-Manual tracking leads to delayed alerts for expiring units
-Zero predictive capability for upcoming demand (surgeries, accidents, seasonal trends)
-No coordination between blood banks, leading to simultaneous shortages and wastage

(The human cost? Preventable deaths, surgery delays, and wasted donor blood that could have saved lives.)

HOW AI CAN SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS:

A. Real-Time Inventory Monitoring
-AI Role: Track blood units in each hospital automatically.
-How: Scans updates from inventory dashboards
Highlights low stock and near-expiry units
-Impact: Immediate alerts prevent shortages and wastage.

B. Predictive Demand Analytics
-AI Role: Forecast blood demand for each blood group.
-How: Analyze historical usage, seasonal patterns, and hospital-specific trends
Predict units likely needed over next 7–14 days
-Impact: Hospitals can proactively prepare donation drives and manage stock.

C. Automated Alerts and Action Recommendations
-AI Role: Act as a 24/7 intelligent assistant.
-How : Sends alerts for low stock or expiry
Suggests blood donation drives

D. Inter-Hospital Coordination (Future Phase)
-AI Role: Network multiple hospitals for optimal redistribution.
-How : Detect surplus in one hospital and shortage in another
Suggest or automate transfers to prevent both wastage and shortages
-Impact: Efficient utilization of blood resources across regions.

HEMORA AI WORKFLOW :

[1️⃣ Hospital Inventory Input]

Staff/hospital enters blood units received, used, and expiring
Data collected for each blood group (A+, A−, B+, B−, AB+, AB−, O+, O−)
│
▼
[2️⃣ AI Agent Monitoring]
Continuously scans inventory data
Tracks low stock, near-expiry units, and usage trends
│
▼
[3️⃣ Predictive Analytics]
Forecasts blood demand for next 7–14 days
Considers historical usage, seasonal trends, hospital emergencies
│
▼
[4️⃣ Alerts & Recommendations]
Sends low-stock and expiry alerts
Suggests actions:
* Use expiring units first
* Prepare for predicted shortage
* Internal redistribution
│
▼
[5️⃣ Emergency Simulation / Inter-Hospital Coordination] (Future phase)
Simulate shortage or emergency
AI recommends or automates transfer from nearby hospitals
Ensures optimal utilization, prevents wastage
│

[Outcome]

Reduced wastage
Fewer shortages
Improved patient outcomes
Data-driven hospital decision-making
🎯 KEY FEATURES:

Live Inventory Dashboard
Intelligent Low Stock Alerts
Expiry Prevention System
Predictive Demand Forecasting
Step 1: Continuous Monitoring
-System tracks every blood unit: arrival date, blood type, expiry date, location
-Real-time updates from blood bank staff
-Dashboard refreshes every 30 seconds

Step 2: Predictive Analysis
-AI model runs daily predictions using:
-90-day historical usage data
-Seasonal patterns (e.g., holiday accident spikes)
-Current inventory levels
-Generates 7-day and 14-day demand forecasts per blood type

Step 3: Proactive Alerting
-When predicted demand > current stock + incoming orders:
-System triggers low stock alert
-Suggests reorder quantity
-Notifies procurement team and blood bank manager
-When expiry approaching:
Alerts clinical staff with "priority use" recommendations
Suggests inter-departmental transfer
Contacts partner blood banks for donation

Step 4: Continuous Learning

--System tracks accuracy of predictions
-Learns from actual vs. predicted usage
-Refines models monthly for improved forecasting
-Generates monthly impact reports (lives saved, wastage reduced, cost saved)

Measurable Impact (Patient Outcomes):
-Reduce preventable deaths from blood shortages
-Eliminate surgery delays due to blood unavailability
-Faster emergency response
-Cut blood wastage through expiry prevention
-Optimize blood donation
How does this project fit within the track?

Hemora: From Guessing to Knowing—AI for Blood Inventory Management

A mother is in labor, a child needs an urgent transfusion, or an accident victim lies in a hospital bed and the blood they desperately need isn’t available. Every second counts, and yet, thousands of lives in India are lost each year not due to lack of donations, but because hospitals cannot track, manage, or predict blood inventory efficiently.

Most hospitals still rely on manual logs or fragmented systems, leaving staff unaware of which blood groups are available, which units are nearing expiry, or what will be needed tomorrow. Shortages strike suddenly, wastage happens silently, and every delay has a human cost.

Our project harnesses Agentic AI to act autonomously on this critical data. The system:

Monitors inventory in real-time

Predicts shortages before they occur

Sends proactive alerts and actionable suggestions

By serving as a 24/7 intelligent assistant, the AI transforms scattered, outdated data into life-saving decisions, ensuring hospitals are prepared before emergencies occur.

Why It Fits Health Tech track:

-Directly Addresses Healthcare Crisis: Blood management is a critical, unsolved problem in hospitals worldwide

-Real-World Applicability: Hospitals desperately need this solution; immediate market demand

-Scalable Technology: Starts with one hospital, expands to regional networks

-Measurable Outcomes: Lives saved, wastage reduced, costs cut

-Human-AI Collaboration: AI handles complex analysis and rapid response; humans make final decisions

Built with ❤️ for a healthier, smarter world.

Every day, a hospital administrator walks into their blood bank and asks the same question: "Do we have enough?"
Today, they're guessing. Tomorrow, they could be knowing. We built Hemora. Hemora doesn't just predict the next shortage. It prevents the next tragedy.

In a world where we can predict tomorrow's weather, stock prices, and traffic patterns, it's inexcusable that we can't predict tomorrow's blood needs. We're not just solving an inventory problem. We're solving a mortality problem disguised as an inventory problem.

Hemora. Because every second counts. And we count every second. AI That Sees Shortages Before They Happen.
